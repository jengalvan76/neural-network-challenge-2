Module 19: Neural Networks and Deep Learning - Part 2
The scope of Module 19 Challenge included the following objectives to a create a branched neural network model that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company and determine the employees best suited for the respective deparments.

**Preprocessing**
- Train_Test_Split
- Standard Scaler
- OneHotEncoder

**Branched Neural Network**
- Create a Branch to predict the Department column - Create Hidden & Output Layers
- Create a Branch to predict the Attrition column - Create Hidden & Output Layers
- Creaste / Compile / Summarize the Model
- Train the model
- Evaluate the model with testing data
- Print the accuracy for both department and attrition
